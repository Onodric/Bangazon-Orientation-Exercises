#### Instructions

1. A block of publicly traded stock has a variety of attributes, we'll look at a few of them. A stock has a ticker symbol and a company name. Create a simple dictionary with ticker symbols and company names.
1. Create a simple list of blocks of stock. These could be tuples with ticker symbols, number of shares, dates and price.
1.Create a purchase history report that computes the full purchase price (shares times dollars) for each block of stock and uses the `stockDict` to look up the full company name. This is the basic relational database join algorithm between two tables.
1.Create a second purchase summary that which accumulates total investment by ticker symbol. In the above sample data, there are two blocks of GE. These can easily be combined by creating a dict where the key is the ticker and the value is the list of blocks purchased. The program makes one pass through the data to create the dict. A pass through the dict can then create a report showing each ticker symbol and all blocks of stock.

## Python Car Sets

#### Instructions

1. Create an empty set named `showroom`.
1. Add four of your favorite car model names to the set.
1. Print the length of your set.
1. Pick one of the items in your show room and add it to the set again.
1. Print your showroom. Notice how there's still only one instance of that model in there.
1. Using `update()`, add two more car models to your showroom with another set.
1. You've sold one of your cars. Remove it from the set with the `discard()` method.

#### Acquiring more cars

1. Now create another set of cars in a variable `junkyard`. Someone who owns a junkyard full of old cars has approached you about buying the entire inventory. In the new set, add some different cars, but also add a few that are the same as in the `showroom` set.
1. Use the `intersection` method to see which cars exist in both the showroom and that junkyard.
1. Now you're ready to buy the cars in the junkyard. Use the `union` method to combine the junkyard into your showroom.
1. Use the `discard()` method to remove any cars that you acquired from the junkyard that you want in your showroom.

## Python Planet List

#### Reference

* [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html)
* [Learn Python - Lists](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists)

### Exercise

1. Use `append()` to add Jupiter and Saturn at the end of the list.
1. Use the `extend()` method to add another list of the last two planets in our solar system to the end of the list.
1. Use `insert()` to add Earth, and Venus in the correct order.
1. Use `append()` again to add Pluto to the end of the list.
1. Now that all the planets are in the list, slice the list in order to get the rocky planets into a new list called `rocky_planets`.
1. Being good amateur astronomers, we know that Pluto is now a dwarf planet, so use the `del` operation to remove it from the end of `planet_list`.

#### Iterating over planets

1. Create another list containing tuples. Each tuple will hold the name of a spacecraft that we have launched, and the names of the planet(s) that it has visited, or landed on. (e.g. `('Cassini', 'Jupiter')`).
1. Iterate over your list of planets, and inside that loop, iterate over the list of tuples. Print, for each planet, which sattelites have visited. 

## Python Tuples

Tuples are like lists, but are immutable. They can't be modified once defined. However, finding values in a tuple is faster than in a list.

#### Instructions

1. Create a tuple named `zoo` that contains your favorite animals.
1. Find one of your animals using the `.index(value)` method on the tuple.
1. Determine if an animal is in your tuple by using `for value in tuple`.
1. Create a variable for each of the animals in your tuple with this cool feature of Python.
1. Convert your tuple into a list.
1. Use `extend()` to add three more animals to your zoo.
1. Convert the list back into a tuple.

## Classes

#### Instructions

Create a class that contains information about employees of a company and define methods to get employee name, job title, and start date.
